*define sets
SETS
Loc location of flow /res "reseviour", pump,farm,release/
t time in season /t1,t2/
size size of built resivour /non,low,high/;
PARAMETERS
Cost(size) Cost to build resivour ($) /non 0, low 6000, High 10000/
Demand(t) water demand per acre(acft per ac) /t1 1, t2 3/
Inflow(t) flow into system per season /t1 600, t2 200/
Storage(size) storage of resivour if built (acft) /non 0,low 300, high 700/;
*things staying constant
Scalar
PumpCap cpacity of the pump (acft per day) /2.2/
Opcost operating cost of the pump ($ per acft) /20/
GW_add additonal water from ground water (acft per day) /2/
Profit profit per ac irrigated /300/
PCost operating cost of the pump /8000/;
*things that change
VARIABLES
I(size) size of buit resivour binary
P wether or not to build pump
A area of irrigated land
X(loc,t) ammount of water provided by each water source
Nbenifit net benifit to farmer;
BINARY VARIABLES I,P;
* Non-negativity constraints
POSITIVE VARIABLES X;

EQUATIONS
    BENIFIT total benift generated by irrigatiion less the costs
    ResStor(t) storage in resivour not overcoming built capacity
    Massbalance(t) flow in equals flow out
    AreaIrr(t) area irrigaated y water supply
    BuildRes only build one res
    PCap(t) pump capacity not to exeed restrictions
    RiverMass(t) mass ballance river  plus reach infil;
BENIFIT.. Nbenifit =E= A*Profit -(Sum(t,P*(PCost+Opcost*X('pump',t)))+SUM(size,I(size)*Cost(size)));
ResStor(t).. X('res',t) =L= SUM(size,Storage(size)*I(size));
AreaIrr(t).. A =L= X('farm',t)+X('pump',t)/(Demand(t));
BuildRes.. 1=e= Sum(size,I(size));
PCap(t).. X('pump',t) =L= PumpCap*365/2;
RiverMass(t).. X('release',t)+GW_add*365/2 =G= X('pump',t);
MassBalance(t)..Inflow(t) =E= X('res',t)+X('farm',t)
