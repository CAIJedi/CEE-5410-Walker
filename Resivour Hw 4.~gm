Homework 4 Problem 1

THE PROBLEM:
A reservoir is designed to provide hydropower and water for irrigation.
At least one unit of water must be kept in the river  each  month  at  point  A.
The  hydropower  turbines  have  a  capacity  of  4  units  of  water  per month (flows are constant during any single month),
and any other releases must bypass the turbines.
The size of farmed area is very large relative to the amount of irrigation water available,
 so there is no upper limit on usable irrigation water.
 The reservoir has a capacity of 9 units, and initial storage  is  5  units  of  water.
The  ending  storage  must  be  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  beginning storage.
 The benefits per unit of water, and the estimated average inflows to the reservoir are given in Table 1.
